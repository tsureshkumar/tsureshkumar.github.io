## Introduction

I am a software developer. I have a lot of experience long enough that I used to
use XMLHttpRequest to develop my first professional interactive web app before
the Ajax term was coined.

In my professional experience, I have developed Access Gateways, Identity
Providers, Reverse Proxies, CDN caches, VPN clients, Class libraries for ".NET
for Linux (mono)" for commerical and opensource projects. Some of my favourite
    parts are implementing OAuth2.0 with openid connect Provider, risk based
    authentication engine and reverse proxy. 

I was a contributor and maintainer for some of the components to Mono project.

I am interested in learning different programming languages and proficient in
c,c++,java,javascript/typescript,golang and python. I had huge interest in
perfecting the art of programming and studied type systems, mainly from Haskell
and Scala.

## What I am currently doing?

I am currently focusing on solving real world security problems and at the
moment working on a large project involving container security at scale.
